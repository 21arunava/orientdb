<pre>

	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.orientechnologies</groupId>
		<artifactId>orientdb-jdbc</artifactId>
		<version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
	</dependency>

</pre>

*How to build a jar-with-dependencies*

Do a 

<pre>mvn assembly:assembly</pre>

to obtain a jar with dependency included. 

It is very usefull to include under applications such as DBvisualizer.

*How can be used in my code?*

First get a connection

<pre>
Properties info = new Properties();
info.put("user", "admin");
info.put("password", "admin");

Connection	conn = (OrientJdbcConnection) DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:orient:remote:localhost/test", info);
</pre>

Then execute a Statement and get the ResultSet

<pre>
Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();

ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT stringKey, intKey, text, length, date FROM Item");

rs.next();

rs.getString("stringKey");
rs.getInt("intKey");

rs.close();
stmt.close();

</pre>
