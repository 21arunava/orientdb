Lucene indexes for OrientDB

Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine library written entirely in Java. It is a technology suitable for nearly any application that requires full-text search, especially cross-platform.
For Lucene documentation visit please [https://lucene.apache.org/](https://lucene.apache.org/)


This project aims to bring the power of Lucene index into OrientDB.
OrientDB does provide it's own index engine for classic index like unique,notunique..etc
so this project is not replacing it's indexing system but extending it throught Lucene.

Two types of index are supported:

1. Full text index
2. Spatial Index
